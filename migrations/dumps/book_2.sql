The Wizarding world has split down the middle, and as the casualties mount, the effects even spill over onto the Muggles. Dumbledore is away from Hogwarts for long periods, and the Order of the Phoenix has suffered grievous losses. And yet, as in all wars, life goes on. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, having passed their O.W.L. level exams, start on their specialist N.E.W.T. courses. Sixthyear students learn to Apparate, losing a few eyebrows in the process. Teenagers flirt and fight and fall in love. Harry becomes captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, while Draco Malfoy pursues his own dark ends. And classes are as fascinating and confounding as ever, as Harry receives some extraordinary help in Potions from the mysterious HalfBlood Prince. Most importantly, Dumbledore and Harry work together to uncover the full and complex story of a boy once named Tom Riddlethe boy who became Lord Voldemort. Like Harry, he was the son of one Muggleborn and one Wizarding parent, raised unloved, and a speaker of Parseltongue. But the similarities end there, as the teenaged Riddle became deeply interested in the Dark objects known as Horcruxes objects in which a wizard can hide part of his soul, if he dares splinter that soul through murder. Harry must use all the tools at his disposal to draw a final secret out of one of Riddles teachers, the sly Potions professor Horace Slughorn.

In addressing them, philosophers have made certain fundamental assumptionsthat we can know our own minds by introspection, that most of our thinking about the world is literal, and that reason is disembodied and universalthat are now called into question by wellestablished results of cognitive science. It has been shown empirically thatMost thought is unconscious. We have no direct conscious access to the mechanisms of thought and language. Our ideas go by too quickly and at too deep a level for us to observe them in any simple way.Abstract concepts are mostly metaphorical. Much of the subject matter of philosopy, such as the nature of time, morality, causation, the mind, and the self, relies heavily on basic metaphors derived from bodily experience. What is literal in our reasoning about such concepts is minimal and conceptually impoverished. All the richness comes from metaphor. For instance, we have two mutually incompatible metaphors for time, both of which represent it as movement through space in one it is a flow past us and in the other a spatial dimension we move along.Mind is embodied. Thought requires a bodynot in the trivial sense that you need a physical brain to think with, but in the profound sense that the very structure of our thoughts comes from the nature of the body. Nearly all of our unconscious metaphors are based on common bodily experiences.Most of the central themes of the Western philosophical tradition are called into question by these findings. The Cartesian person, with a mind wholly separate from the body, does not exist. The Kantian person, capable of moral action according to the dictates of a universal reason, does not exist. The phenomenological person, capable of knowing his or her mind entirely through introspection alone, does not exist. The utilitarian person, the Chomskian person, the poststructuralist person, the computational person, and the person defined by analytic philosopy all do not exist.Then what doesLakoff and Johnson show that a philosopy responsible to the science of mind offers radically new and detailed understandings of what a person is. After first describing the philosophical stance that must follow from taking cognitive science seriously, they reexamine the basic concepts of the mind, time, causation, morality, and the self then they rethink a host of philosophical traditions, from the classical Greeks through Kantian morality through modern analytic philosopy. They reveal the metaphorical structure underlying each mode of thought and show how the metaphysics of each theory flows from its metaphors. Finally, they take on two major issues of twentiethcentury philosopy how we conceive rationality, and how we conceive language.',1999,4.07,640,1100,64.96,'science_fiction'),(3045,9780465069903,'River Out of Eden','A Darwinian View of Life','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U5z2vQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','How did the replication bomb we call life begin and where in the world, or rather, in the universe, is it heading Writing with characteristic wit and an ability to clarify complex phenomena the New York Times described his style as the sort of science writing that makes the reader feel like a genius, Richard Dawkins confronts this ancient mystery.',1996,3.97,172,5653,55.86,'fantasy'),(3047,9780465081424,'A Conflict Of Visions',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DNXk8bV6vaoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','Controversies in politics arise from many sources, but the conflicts that endure for generations or centuries show a remarkably consistent pattern.

A band of California cops set loose in nomansland to come home heroes. Or come home dead. Not since Joseph Wambaughs bestselling The Onion Field has there been a true police story as fascinating, as totally gripping as Lines and Shadows. The media hailed them as heroes. Others denounced them as lawless renegades. A squad of tough cops called the Border Crime Task Force. A commando team sent to patrol the snakeinfested nomansland south of San Diego. Not to apprehend the thousands of illegal aliens slipping into the U.S., but to stop the ruthless bandits who preyed on them nightlyrelentlessly robbing, raping, and murdering defenseless men, women, and children. The task force plan was simple. They would disguise themselves as illegal aliens. They would confront the murderous shadows of the night. Yet each time they walked into the violent blackness along the border, they came closer to another boundary linea fragile line within each man. And crossing it meant destroying their sanity and their lives. Praise for Lines and Shadows With each book, it seems, Mr. Wambaughs skill as a writer increases. . . .

The trilogy opens with THE 42nd PARALLEL, where we find a young country at the dawn of the twentieth century. Slowly, in stories artfully spliced together, the lives and fortunes of five characters unfold. Mac, Janey, Eleanor, Ward, and Charley are caught on the storm track of this parallel and blown New Yorkward.

Tolkien for long believed would be a far shorter book, a sequel to The Hobbit. The enlargement of Bilbos magic ring into the supremely potent and dangerous Ruling Ring of the Dark Lord is traced and the precise moment is seen when, in an astonishing and unforeseen leap in the earliest narrative, a Black Rider first rode into the Shire, his significance still unknown. The character of the hobbit called Trotter afterwards Strider or Aragorn is developed while his indentity remains an absolute puzzle, and the suspicion only very slowly becomes certainty that he must after all be a Man.

Though now a fading memory in Europes heartland, the true story of Prussia offers a remarkable glimpse into the dynamic rise of modern Europe. What we find is a kingdom that existed nearly half a millennium ago as a patchwork of territorial fragments, with neither significant resources nor a coherent culture. With its capital in Berlin, Prussia grew from being a small, poor, disregarded medieval state into one of the most vigorous and powerful nations in Europe. Iron Kingdom traces Prussias involvement in the continents foundational religious and political conflagrations from the devastations of the Thirty Years War through centuries of political machinations to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, from the enlightenment of Frederick the Great to the destructive conquests of Napoleon, and from the iron and blood policies of Bismarck to the creation of the German Empire in 1871, and all that implied for the tumultuous twentieth century. By 1947, Prussia was deemed an intolerable threat to the safety of Europe what is often forgotten, Clark argues, is that it had also been an exemplar of the European humanistic tradition, boasting a formidable government administration, an incorruptible civil service, and religious tolerance. Clark demonstrates how a state deemed the bane of twentiethcentury Europe has played an incalculable role in Western civilizations fortunes. Iron Kingdom is a definitive, gripping account of Prussias fascinating, influential, and critical role in modern times.',2006,4.14,776,2413,63.53,'thriller'),(3864,9780679643425,'The Murders in the Rue Morgue','The Dupin Tales','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8FHavR4kEucC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','The story of a retired detective who is called upon to solve a perplexing pair of murders is accompanied by commentary, biographical notes, and a reading group guide.',2006,3.87,160,5994,62.5,'science_fiction'),(3867,9780679720225,'The Fall',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OqEOMA-X0EkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','A mans confessions reveal his perception of justice and his own downfall',1956,4.05,147,50175,24.04,'thriller'),(3868,9780679721031,'Hiroshima',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1z89O0uIlLwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','The classic tale of the day the first atom bomb was dropped offers a haunting evocation of the memories of survivors and an appeal to the conscience of humanity',1989,3.96,152,49487,14.37,'science_fiction'),(3869,9780679721819,'Mama Day',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BqffU2XpzO0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','In a small Georgia town, Mama Day, uses her gifts as a seer and healer, but her powers are ultimately tested when her beloved nieces life hangs in the balance',1989,4.17,312,8690,79.74,'fantasy'),(3870,9780679722311,'Where Im Calling from','New and Selected Stories','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=amQvCBCLWA4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','A unique collection by an extraordinary writer, this collection of Carvers best spans his literary career and includes seven new works.

Harry Harrison, author of Adventures of the Stanless Steel Rat Let there be light, and let there always be Roger Zelazny.Philip Jos Farmer, author of To Your Scattered Bodies Go From Publishers Weekly This odd novel, left incomplete when Bester died in 1987, was finished by Zelazny, who himself died in 1995. In his introduction, Bear refers to Bester The Deceivers and Zelazny Donnerjack as masters of SF jazz, geniuses of improvisation, and the book has that feel to it. The plot is full of bizarre twists and turns. Neat ideas surface and disappear in an eyeblink and characters transform radically from one page to the next. Alf Noir, an investigative reporter, is sent to Rome to look into the mysterious Black Place of the SoulChanger and its enigmatic proprietor, Adam Maser. Alf discovers that Maser is a Psychbroker, a sort of pawnbroker of the spirit, dealing in emotions, talents and psychological traits. Want more courage, the ability to see into the infrared, an understanding of ancient Persian Maser will trade it to you for your mindreading ability, or a rare coin, or perhaps for the secret of the collective unconscious. Alf discovers that Maser isnt human, but a highly evolved cat from the far future. Nothing is what it seems and no one can be trusted, not even Masers sexy assistant, an evolved snake with whom Alf has an affair. Theres much fun to be had here, but the book doesnt represent either writer in top form. Besters style in the first part of the novel seems dated, and things dont gel until Zelazny takes over halfway through the book.

Thompsons legions of fans have waited a decade for this book. They will not be disappointed. His notorious Screwjack is as salacious, unsettling, and brutally lyrical as it has been rumored to be since the private printing in 1991 of three hundred fine collectors copies and twentysix leatherbound presentation copies. Only the first of the three pieces included here  Mescalito, published in Thompsons 1990 collection Songs of the Doomed  has been available to the public, making the trade edition of Screwjack a major publishing event. We live in a jungle of pending disasters, Thompson warns in Mescalito, a chronicle of his first mescaline experience and what it sparked in him while he was alone in an L.A. hotel room in February 1969  including a bout of paranoia that would have made most people just scream no, once and for all. But for Thompson, along with the downside came a burst of creativity too powerful to ignore. The result is a poetic, perceptive, and wildly funny streamofconsciousness take on 1969 America as only Hunter S. Thompson could see it. Screwjack just gets weirder with its second offering, Death of a Poet. As Thompson describes this trailerpark confrontation with the dark side of a deservingly doomed friend Whoops, I thought. Welcome to the night train. The heart of the collection lies in its final, title piece, an unnaturally poignant love story. What makes the romantic tale Screwjack so touching, for all its queerness, is the aching melancholy in its depiction of the modern mans burden that we are doomed. Mama has gone off to Real Estate School ...and after that maybe even to Law School. We will never see her again. Ostensibly written by Raoul Duke, Screwjack begins with an editors note explaining of Thompsons alter ego that the first few lines contain no warning of the madness and fear and lust that came more and more to plague him and dominate his life.... I am guilty, Lord, Thompson writes, but I am also a lover  and I am one of your best people, as you know and yea tho I have walked in many strange shadows and acted crazy from time to time and even drooled on many High Priests, I have not been an embarrassment to you.... Nor has Hunter S. Thompson been to American literature. Quite the contrary What the legendary Gonzo journalist proves with Screwjack is just how brilliant a prose stylist he really is, amid all the hilarity. As Thompson puts it in his introduction, the three stories here build like Bolero to a faster  wilder climax that will drag the reader relentlessly up a hill,  then drop him off a cliff....That is the Desired Effect.',2000,3.57,64,3363,71.02,'fantasy'),(4047,9780684856025,'Cryptozoology A To Z','The Encyclopedia Of Loch Monsters Sasquatch Chupacabras And Other Authentic M','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4ZTgX7BZXqoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','Explores the truth and the myths behind such legendary creatures as the Loch Ness monster and Sasquatch',1999,4,272,761,72.72,'horror'),(4048,9780687002825,'Exclusion and Embrace','A Theological Exploration of Identity Otherness and Reconciliation','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Cqto7sVhTS8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','Life at the end of the twentieth century presents us with a disturbing reality. Otherness, the simple fact of being different in some way, has come to be defined as in and of itself evil. Miroslav Volf contends that if the healing word of the gospel is to be heard today, Christian theology must find ways of speaking that address the hatred of the other. Reaching back to the New Testament metaphor of salvation as reconciliation, Volf proposes the idea of embrace as a theological response to the problem of exclusion. Increasingly we see that exclusion has become the primary sin, skewing our perceptions of reality and causing us to react out of fear and anger to all those who are not within our evernarrowing circle. In light of this, Christians must learn that salvation comes, not only as we are reconciled to God, and not only as we learn to live with one another, but as we take the dangerous and costly step of opening ourselves to the other, of enfolding him or her in the same embrace with which we have been enfolded by God. Is there any hope of embracing our enemies Of opening the door to reconciliation Miroslav Volf, a Yale University theologian, has won the 2002 Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion for his book, Exclusion  Embrace A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation Abingdon, 1996. Volf argues that exclusion of people who are alien or different is among the most intractable problems in the world today. He writes, It may not be too much to claim that the future of our world will depend on how we deal with identity and difference. The issue is urgent. The ghettos and battlefields throughout the worldin the living rooms, in inner cities, or on the mountain rangestestify indisputably to its importance. A Croatian by birth, Volf takes as a starting point for his analysis the recent civil war and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, but he readily finds other examples of cultural, ethnic, and racial conflict to illustrate his points. And, since September 11, one can scarcely help but plug the new world players into his incisive descriptions of the dynamics of interethnic and international strife. Exclusion happens, Volf argues, wherever impenetrable barriers are set up that prevent a creative encounter with the other. It is easy to assume that exclusion is the problem or practice of barbarians who live over there, but Volf persuades us that exclusion is all too often our practice here as well. Modern western societies, including American society, typically recite their histories as narratives of inclusion, and Volf celebrates the truth in these narratives. But he points out that these narratives conveniently omit certain groups who disturb the integrity of their happy ending plots. Therefore such narratives of inclusion invite long and gruesome counternarratives of exclusionthe brutal histories of slavery and of the decimation of Native American populations come readily to mind, but more current examples could also be found. Most proposed solutions to the problem of exclusion have focused on social arrangementswhat kind of society ought we to create in order to accommodate individual or communal difference Volf focuses, rather, on what kind of selves we need to be in order to live in harmony with others. In addressing the topic, Volf stresses the social implications of divine selfgiving. The Christian scriptures attest that God does not abandon the godless to their evil, but gives of Godself to bring them into communion. We are called to do likewisewhoever our enemies and whoever we may be. The divine mandate to embrace as God has embraced is summarized in Pauls injunction to the Romans Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you Romans 157. Susan R. Garrett, Coordinator of the Religion Award, said that the Grawemeyer selection committee praised Volfs book on many counts. These included its profound interpretation of certain pivotal passages of Scripture and its brilliant engagement with contemporary theology, philosophy, critical theory, and feminist theory. Volfs focus is not on social strategies or programs but, rather, on showing us new ways to understand ourselves and our relation to our enemies. He helps us to imagine new possibilities for living against violence, injustice, and deception. Garrett added that, although addressed primarily to Christians, Volfs theological statement opens itself to religious pluralism by upholding the importance of different religious and cultural traditions for the formation of personal and group identity. The call to embrace the other is never a call to remake the other into ones own image. Volfwho had just delivered a lecture on the topic of Exclusion and Embrace at a prayer breakfast for the United Nations when the first hijacked plane hit the World Trade Centerwill present a lecture and receive his award in Louisville during the first week of April, 2002. The annual Religion Award, which includes a cash prize of 200,000, is given jointly by Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary and the University of Louisville to the authors or originators of creative works that contribute significantly to an understanding of the relationship between human beings and the divine, and ways in which this relationship may inspire or empower human beings to attain wholeness, integrity, or meaning, either individually or in community.

Richard Rorty, a Princeton professor who had contributed to the analytic tradition in philosophy, was now attempting to shrug off all the central problems with which it had long been preoccupied. After publication, the Press was barely able to keep up with demand, and the book has since gone on to become one of its alltime bestsellers in philosophy. Rorty argued that, beginning in the seventeenth century, philosophers developed an unhealthy obsession with the notion of representation. They compared the mind to a mirror that reflects reality. In their view, knowledge is concerned with the accuracy of these reflections, and the strategy employed to obtain this knowledgethat of inspecting, repairing, and polishing the mirrorbelongs to philosophy. Rortys book was a powerful critique of this imagery and the tradition of thought that it spawned. He argued that the questions about truth posed by Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and modern epistemologists and philosophers of language simply couldnt be answered and were, in any case, irrelevant to serious social and cultural inquiry. This stance provoked a barrage of criticism, but whatever the strengths of Rortys specific claims, the book had a therapeutic effect on philosophy. It reenergized pragmatism as an intellectual force, steered philosophy back to its roots in the humanities, and helped to make alternatives to analytic philosophy a serious choice for young graduate students. Twentyfive years later, the book remains a mustread for anyone seriously concerned about the nature of philosophical inquiry and what philosophers can and cannot do to help us understand and improve the world.',1980,4,424,2720,22.44,'horror'),(4121,9780691020419,'Kierkegaards Writings','3Eitheror part I','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=azb9xgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',NULL,1987,4.25,702,1073,39.43,'science_fiction'),(4125,9780691037387,'Making Democracy Work','Civic Traditions in Modern Italy','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6hpoGGrHH-oC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','Why do some democratic governments succeed and others fail In a world full of hope for democratization but wary of government failure, this book offers empirical evidence for the importance of civic community in developing successful institutions. As part of a unique experiment begun in 1970 when Italy created new governments for each of its regions  regions that vary greatly from the standpoint of wealth, social structure, and political leanings  Robert Putnam and his collaborators spent two decades evaluating the performance of these governments in such fields as agriculture, housing, and health services. Their findings were surprising regions that enjoy effective government in the 1990s have inherited a legacy of civic engagement that can be traced back to the early Middle Ages. Just as Tocqueville traveled to America to try to understand democracy, Putnam and his colleagues draw broad lessons for democratic theory from their twentyyear journey through Italy. Their conclusions challenge the simpleminded thesis of the primacy of economics and the easy optimism of social engineers.

When Enders Game was first published as a novella twentyfive years ago few would have predicted that it would become one of the most successful ventures in publishing history. Expanded into a novel in 1985, Enders Game won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for Best Novel. Never out of print and translated into dozens of languages, it is the rare work of fiction that can truly be said to have transcended a genre. Enders Game and its sequels have won dozens of prestigious awards and are as popular today among teens and young readers as adults. First Meetings is a collection of three novellasplus the original Enders Gamethat journey into the origins and the destiny of one Ender Wiggin. The Polish Boy begins in the wake between the first two Bugger Wars when the Hegemony is desperate to recruit brilliant military commanders to repel the alien invasion. In John Paul Wigginthe future father of Ender they believe they may have found their man. Or boy.

It is many years since the end of the Bugger Wars in The Investment Counselor. Enders reputation as a hero and savior has suffered a horrible reversal. Banished from Earth and slandered as a mass murderer, twentyyearold Andrew Wiggin wanders incognito from planet to planet as a fugitive.

Noted New Testament scholar Richard Bauckham challenges the prevailing assumption that the accounts of Jesus circulated as anonymous community traditions, asserting instead that they were transmitted in the names of the original eyewitness. To drive home this controversial point, Bauckham draws on internal literary evidence, the use of personal names in firstcentury Jewish Palestine, and recent developments in the understanding of oral tradition. Jesus and the Eyewitnesses also taps into the rich resources of modern study of memory, especially in cognitive psychology, refuting the conclusions of the form critics and calling New Testament scholarship to make a clean break with this longdominant tradition. Finally, Bauckham challenges readers to end the classic division between the historical Jesus and the Christ of faith, proposing instead the Jesus of testimony as presented by the Gospels. Sure to ignite heated debate on the precise character of the testimony about Jesus, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses is a groundbreaking work that will be valued by scholars, students, and all who seek to understand the origins of the Gospels.',2006,4.3,538,632,97.77,'science_fiction'),(4885,9780803261839,'Pirates of Venus',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PrnrGJ1F0AMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','Astronaut Carson Napier crashes on Venus.',1934,3.69,179,1203,71.25,'fantasy'),(4887,9780676977110,'Never Let Me Go',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=taygTbyo9w4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','A gothic tour de force.

Black Elk met the distinguished poet, writer, and critic John G. Neihardt 18811973 in 1930 on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and chose Neihardt to tell his story. Neihardt understood and conveyed Black Elks experiences in this powerful and inspirational message for all humankind. When Black Elk received his great vision, white settlers were invading the Lakotas homeland, decimating buffalo herds, and threatening to extinguish the Lakotas way of life. The Lakotas fought fiercely to retain their freedom and way of life, a dogged resistance that resulted in a remarkable victory at the Little Bighorn and an unspeakable tragedy at Wounded Knee. Black Elk Speaks offers much more than a precious glimpse of a vanished time, however. As related by Neihardt, Black Elks searing visions of the unity of humanity and the earth have made this book a venerated spiritual classic. Whether appreciated as the poignant tale of a Lakota life, a history of a Native nation, or an enduring spiritual testament, Black Elk Speaks is unforgettable. This new edition features two additional essays by John G. Neihardt that further illuminate his experience with Black Elk an essay by Alexis Petri, greatgranddaughter of John G.

Eliot Asinof has reconstructed the entire scenebyscene story of the fantastic scandal in which eight Chicago White Sox players arranged with the nations leading gamblers to throw the Series in Cincinnati. Mr. Asinof vividly describes the tense meetings, the hitches in the conniving, the actual plays in which the Series was thrown, the Grand Jury indictment, and the famous 1921 trial. Moving behind the scenes, he perceptively examines the motives and backgrounds of the players and the conditions that made the improbable fix all too possible. Here, too, is a graphic picture of the American underworld that managed the fix, the deeply shocked newspapermen who uncovered the story, and the warexhausted nation that turned with relief and pride to the Series, only to be rocked by the scandal.

Its founder was Zeno of Cytium not to be confused with Zeno of Elea, who discovered the famous paradoxes. He was born in Cyprus about 336 b.c., but all of his philosophical activity took place in Athens. For more than 500 years Stoicism was one of the most influential and fruitful philosophical movements in the GraecoRoman world. The works of the earlier Stoics survive only in fragmentary quotations from other authors, but from the Renaissance until well into the nineteenth century, Stoic ethical thought was one of the most important ancient influences on European ethics, particularly because of the descriptions of it by Cicero, through surviving works by the Stoics Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and also Epictetusand also because of the effect that it had had in antiquity, and continued to have into the nineteenth century, on Christian ethical views. Nowadays an undergraduate or graduate student learning about ancient philosophy in a university course may well hear only about Plato and Aristotle, along perhaps with the presocratics but in the history of Western thought and education this situation is somewhat atypical, and in most periods a comparable student would have learned as much or more about Stoicism, as well as two other major ancient philosophical movements, Epicureanism and Scepticism. In spite of this lack of explicit acquaintance with Stoic philosophers and their works, however, most students will recognize in Epictetus various ideas that are familiar through their effects on other thinkers, notably Spinoza, in our intellectual tradition.',1983,4.22,35,650,98.84,'action_adventure'),(5448,9780936197449,'Yes Your Teen Is Crazy','Loving Your Kid Without Losing Your Mind','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=51wMAAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','A survival guide for parents helps beleagured adults navigate their childrens teen years, with advice on how to turn adolescents into strong, confident, productive adults.',2002,4.3,332,759,90.75,'fantasy'),(5449,9780938045557,'The Naked Warrior','Master the Secrets of the Superstrong Using Bodyweight Exercises Only','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WzI6NQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','Have you noticedthe greater a mans skill, the more he achieves with less And the skill of strength is no exception.
