It is not about visionary product concepts or visionary products or visionary market insights. Nor is it about just having a corporate vision. This is a book about something far more important, enduring, and substantial. This is a book about visionary companies. So write Jim Collins and Jerry Porras in this groundbreaking book that shatters myths, provides new insights, and gives practical guidance to those who would like to build landmark companies that stand the test of time. Drawing upon a sixyear research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and longlasting companies  they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926  and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day  as startups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, WalMart, HewlettPackard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals How, for example, did Procter  Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the worlds best commercial aircraft company  what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished outstanding companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies. Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twentyfirst century and beyond.',2004,3.98,368,49529,92.28,'fantasy'),(174,9780060566685,'Fluke','Or I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pIHvlgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','Just why do humpback whales sing Thats the question that has marine behavioral biologist Nate Quinn and his crew poking, charting, recording, and photographing very big, wet, gray marine mammals.

Situating Jefferson within the context of Americas evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years, Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it. Conflicted by power, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of Americas development, this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer, he was an awkward public speaker a reluctant candidate, he left an indelible presidential legacy. Jeffersons statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France, doubling the size of the nation, and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition, opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jeffersons handling of the Barbary War, a lesserknown chapter of his political career, when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states, and the subsequent war with Tripoli, led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of Americas reputation regarding national defense. In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama the fledgling nations struggle for independence, formed in the crucible of the eighteenthcentury Enlightenment, and, in its shadow, the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution. This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in American history  or in the ambiguities of human nature.',2005,3.92,188,2181,64.24,'action_adventure'),(207,9780060598976,'Muhammad','A Prophet for Our Time','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JUz3Z0iv_pgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','Muhammad was born in 570 CE, and over the following sixty years built a thriving spiritual community, laying the foundations of a religion that changed the course of world history.

Now, in Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining. Believing in Jesus does not mean believing doctrines about him, Borg writes. Rather, it means to give ones heart, ones self at its deepest level, to . . . the living Lord. Drawing on his own journey from a naive, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian lifeone not rooted in creeds or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community. In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus character spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement founder. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus, showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith.

Reading the Bible Again for the First Time provides a muchneeded solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet contemporary understanding of the scriptures. Many mistakenly believe there are no choices other than fundamentalism or simply rejecting the Bible as something that can bring meaning to our lives. Answering this modern dilemma, acclaimed author Marcus Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile the Bible with both a scientific and critical way of thinking and our deepest spiritual needs, leading to a contemporary yet grounded experience of the sacred texts. This seminal book shows you how to read the Bible as it should be examinedin an approach the author calls historicalmetaphorical. Borg explores what the Scriptures meant to the ancient communities that produced and lived by them. He then helps us to discover the meaning of these stories, providing the knowledge and perspective to make the wisdom of the Bible an essential part of our modern lives. The author argues that the conventional way of seeing the Bibles origin, authority, and interpretation has become unpersuasive to millions of people in our time, and that we need a fresh way of encountering the Bible that takes the texts seriously but not literally, even as it takes seriously who we have become. Borg traces his personal spiritual journey, describing for readers how he moved from an unquestioning childhood belief in the biblical stories to a more powerful and dynamic relationship with the Bible as a sacred text brimming with meaning and guidance. Using his own experience as an example, he reveals how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in the misinterpretation of sacred texts as historical record and divine dictation, and opens readers to a truer, more abundant perspective. This unique book invites everyonewhatever ones religious backgroundto engage the Bible, wrestle with its meaning, explore its mysteries, and understand its relevance. Borg shows us how to encounter the Bible in a fresh way that rejects the limits of simple literalism and opens up rich possibilities for our lives.',2002,4.13,321,2875,43.06,'fantasy'),(210,9780060622138,'Shadow of the Almighty','The Life and Testament of Jim Elliot','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QQCG9mNU1eAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','The bestselling account of the martyrdom of Jim Elliot and four other missionaries at the hands of the Auca Indians in Ecuador.

The trial and condemnation of Socrates on charges of heresy and corrupting young minds is a defining moment in the history of Classical Athens. In tracing these events through four dialogues, Plato also developed his own philosophy, based on Socrates manifesto for a life guided by selfresponsibility. Euthyphro finds Socrates outside the courthouse, debating the nature of piety, while the Apology is his robust rebuttal of the charges of impiety and a defence of the philosophers life. In the Crito, while awaiting execution in prison, Socrates counters the arguments of friends urging him to escape. Finally, in the Phaedo, he is shown calmly confident in the face of death, skilfully arguing the case for the immortality of the soul. Hugh Tredennicks landmark 1954 translation has been revised by Harold Tarrant, reflecting changes in Platonic studies, with an introduction and expanded introductions to each of the four dialogues. Plato c.427347 BC stands with Socrates and Aristotle as one of the shapers of the whole intellectual tradition of the West. He founded the Academy in Athens, the first permanent institution devoted to philosophical research and teaching, and the prototype of all Western universities.

One swallow does not make a summer neither does one day. Similarly neither can one day, or a brief space of time, make a man blessed and happy In The Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle sets out to examine the nature of happiness. He argues that happiness consists in activity of the soul in accordance with virtue, for example with moral virtues, such as courage, generosity and justice, and intellectual virtues, such as knowledge, wisdom and insight. The Ethics also discusses the nature of practical reasoning, the value and the objects of pleasure, the different forms of friendship, and the relationship between individual virtue, society and the State. Aristotles work has had a profound and lasting influence on all subsequent Western thought about ethical matters. Aristotle 38422 BC studied at the Academy of Plato for 20 years and then established his own school and research institute, The Lyceum. His writings, which were of extraordinary range, profoundly affected the whole course of ancient and medieval philosophy and are still eagerly studied and debated by philosophers today.

This Penguin Classics edition is edited by Stella McNichol with an introduction and notes by Elaine Showalter.Past, present and future are brought together one momentous June day in 1923.Clarissa Dalloway, elegant and vivacious, is preparing for a party while reminiscing about her childhood romance with Peter Walsh, and dwelling on her daughter Elizabeths rapidlyapproaching adulthood. In another part of London, war veteran Septimus Smith is shellshocked and on the brink of madness, slowly spiralling towards selfannihilation. Their experiences mingling, yet never quite meeting, Virginia Woolf masterfully portrays a serendipitous unity of inner lives, converging as the party reaches its glittering climax. Virginia Woolf 18821941 is regarded as a major 20th century author and essayist, a key figure in literary history as a feminist and modernist, and the centre of The Bloomsbury Group. This informal collective of artists and writers which included Lytton Strachey and Roger Fry, exerted a powerful influence over early twentiethcentury British culture. Between 1925 and 1931 Virginia Woolf produced what are now regarded as her finest masterpieces, from Mrs Dalloway1925 to the poetic and highly experimental novel The Waves1931. She also maintained an astonishing output of literary criticism, short fiction, journalism and biography, including the playfully subversive Orlando1928 and A Room of Ones Own1929 a passionate feminist essay.If you enjoyed Mrs Dalloway, you might like James Joyces Ulysses, also available in Penguin Classics.The books celebrated stream of consciousness is one of the few genuine innovations in the history of the novelNew Yorker',2000,3.79,233,2128,91.11,'horror'),(851,9780141182582,'The Collected Dorothy Parker',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9ch-AAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','With a biting wit and perceptive insight, Dorothy Parker examines the social mores of her day and exposes the darkness beneath the dazzle.

Ulysses has been labelled dirty, blasphemous and unreadable. In a famous 1933 court decision, Judge John M. Woolsey declared it an emetic bookalthough he found it not quite obscene enough to disallow its importation into the United Statesand Virginia Woolf was moved to decry James Joyces cloacal obsession. None of these descriptions, however, do the slightest justice to the novel. To this day it remains the modernist masterpiece, in which the author takes both Celtic lyricism and vulgarity to splendid extremes. It is funny, sorrowful, and even in its own way suspenseful.

Saids Orientalism has defined our understanding of colonialism and empire, and this Penguin Modern Classics edition contains a preface written by Said shortly before his death in 2003. In this highlyacclaimed work, Edward Said surveys the history and nature of Western attitudes towards the East, considering orientalism as a powerful European ideological creation  a way for writers, philosophers and colonial administrators to deal with the otherness of eastern culture, customs and beliefs. He traces this view through the writings of Homer, Nerval and Flaubert, Disraeli and Kipling, whose imaginative depictions have greatly contributed to the Wests romantic and exotic picture of the Orient. Drawing on his own experiences as an Arab Palestinian living in the West, Said examines how these ideas can be a reflection of European imperialism and racism. Edward W. Said 19352003 was a PalestinianAmerican cultural critic and author, born in Jerusalem and educated in Egypt and the United States.

This Penguin Modern Classics edition is edited by Donald A. Yates and James E. Irby, with an introduction by James E. Irby and a preface by Andr Maurois. Jorge Luis Borges was a literary spellbinder whose tales of magic, mystery and murder are shot through with deep philosophical paradoxes. This collection brings together many of his stories, including the celebrated Library of Babel, whose infinite shelves contain every book that could ever exist, Funes the Memorious the tale of a man fated never to forget a single detail of his life, and Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote, in which a French poet makes it his lifes work to create an identical copy of Don Quixote. In later life, dogged by increasing blindness, Borges used essays and brief tantalising parables to explore the enigma of time, identity and imagination. Playful and disturbing, scholarly and seductive, his is a haunting and utterly distinctive voice. Jorge Luis Borges 18991986 was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. A poet, critic and short story writer, he received numerous awards for his work including the 1961 International Publishers Prize shared with Samuel Beckett. He has a reasonable claim, along with Kafka and Joyce, to be one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century.

They are found in all complex living things, and in that sense, they are fundamental for driving complex life on the planet. But there is much more to them than that. Mitochondria have their own DNA, with their own small collection of genes, separate from those in the cell nucleus. It is thought that they were once bacteria living independent lives. Their enslavement within the larger cell was a turning point in the evolution of life, enabling the development of complex organisms and, closely related, the origin of two sexes. Unlike the DNA in the nucleus, mitochondrial DNA is passed down exclusively or almost exclusively via the female line. Thats why it has been used by some researchers to trace human ancestry daughtertomother, to Mitochondrial Eve. Mitochondria give us important information about our evolutionary history. And thats not all. Mitochondrial genes mutate much faster than those in the nucleus because of the free radicals produced in their energygenerating role. This high mutation rate lies behind our ageing and certain congenital diseases. The latest research suggests that mitochondria play a key role in degenerative diseases such as cancer, through their involvement in precipitating cell suicide. Mitochondria, then, are pivotal in power, sex, and suicide. In this fascinating and thoughtprovoking book, Nick Lane brings together the latest research findings in this exciting field to show how our growing understanding of mitochondria is shedding light on how complex life evolved, why sex arose why dont we just bud, and why we age and die. This understanding is of fundamental importance, both in understanding how we and all other complex life came to be, but also in order to be able to control our own illnesses, and delay our degeneration and death.

By the time Goethes Theory of Colours appeared in 1810, the wavelength theory of light and color had been firmly established. To Goethe, the theory was the result of mistaking an incidental result for an elemental principle. Far from pretending to a knowledge of physics, he insisted that such knowledge was an actual hindrance to understanding. He based his conclusions exclusively upon exhaustive personal observation of the phenomena of color. Of his own theory, Goethe was supremely confident From the philosopher, we believe we merit thanks for having traced the phenomena of colours to their first sources, to the circumstances under which they appear and are, and beyond which no further explanation respecting them is possible. Goethes scientific conclusions have, of course, long since been thoroughly demolished, but the intelligent reader of today may enjoy this work on quite different grounds for the beauty and sweep of his conjectures regarding the connection between color and philosophical ideas for an insight into early nineteenthcentury beliefs and modes of thought and for the flavor of life in Europe just after the American and French Revolutions. The book does not have to be studied to be appreciated. Goethes subjective theory of colors permits him to speak most persuasively of color harmony and aesthetics. In some readers these notions will evoke a positive response on their merits. Others may regard them as pure fantasy, but savor the grace and style of their exposition. The work may also be read as an accurate guide to the study of color phenomena. Goethes conclusions have been repudiated, but no one quarrels with his reporting of the facts to be observed. With simple objectsvessels, prisms, lenses, and the likethe reader will be led through a demonstration course not only in subjectively produced colors, but also in the observable physical phenomena of color.

Manovich uses concepts from film theory, art history, literary theory, and computer science and also develops new theoretical constructs, such as cultural interface, spatial montage, and cinegratography.

Many who wish to remain are intimidated by Church and Crown and become Catholics, but several hundred thousand choose to retain their religion and depart given little time to flee, some perish even before they can escape from Spain. Yonah Toledano, the 15yearold son of a celebrated Spanish silversmith, has seen his father and brother die during these terrible days  victims whose murders go almost unnoticed in a time of mass upheaval.

It is that many of the problems we face  from crime to teenage delinquency to traffic jams  behave like epidemics.

They are capable of sudden and dramatic changes in direction. Years of wellintentioned intervention may have no impact at all, yet the right intervention  at just the right time  can start a cascade of change. Many of the social ills that face us today, in other words, are as inherently volatile as the epidemics that periodically sweep through the human population little things can cause them to tip at any time and if we want to understand how to confront and solve them we have to understand what those Tipping Points are.

The end of history. The new world order. Fine phrases, but as Jack Ryan is about to discover, history isnt dead yet  and only the nature of the threat is new. On the Pacific island of Saipan, a wealthy Japanese businessman regards his newbought land with satisfaction. In the Indian Ocean off Sri Lanka, a foreign navy begins a series of highly unusual exercises. At the headquarters of Americas major stockclearing corporation, an engineer brings a customized computer program online for the first time, and smiles at his own private joke. Three seemingly unrelated incidents, but all just the first links in a chain of events that will stun the world. Called out of retirement to serve as the new Presidents National Security Advisor, Jack Ryan quickly realizes that the problems of peace are fully as complex as those of war. Enemies have become friends, friends enemies, and even the form of conflict has changed. What he cannot realize, however, is just how close the next conflict is. And when one of those new enemies readies a strike not only at Americas territory, but at the heart of her economy, it is Ryan, with the help of CIA officers John Clark and Domingo Chavez, who must prepare an untested President to meet the challenge, if Ryan can only figure out how.
