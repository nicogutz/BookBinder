Barnes  Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influencesbiographical, historical, and literaryto enrich each readers understanding of these enduring works. Anton Chekhov invented the modern short story. With writing that is concise, realistic, and evocative, he became a sort of photographer in words, less interested in plot than in the subtleties of mood and atmosphere, and the telling detail. His characters, always vividly drawn, come from all walks of life and often seem to be caught up in a world they dont quite understand. Early in his brief literary career, Chekhov outlined in a letter to his brother his idea of the ingredients of a good short story. Arguing against moral judgments and political, economic, or social commentary, he wrote, To describe . . . you need . . . to free yourself from the personal expression. . . . Subjectivity is a terrible thing. Instead, he favored objectivity, truthfulness, originality, compassion, and brevity. Although his writing developed and matured, he remained largely faithful to these principles. This new selection of twentythree stories explores the entire range of Chekhovs short fiction, from early sketches, such as The Cooks Wedding 1885 and On the Road 1886 to late works, such as In the Ravine 1900 and The Bishop 1902. Ward No. 6 and Other Stories includes some of his most popular tales, such as the title story and The Lady with the Dog 1899, as well as several lesserknown works, no less masterful in their composition. David Plante is a Professor of Writing at Columbia University. He is the author of many novels, including The Ghost of Henry James, The Family nominated for the National Book Award, and The Woods.

Tom Jones is widely regarded as one of the first and most influential English novels. It is certainly the funniest. Tom Jones, the hero of the book, is introduced to the reader as the ward of a liberal Somerset squire. Tom is a generous but slightly wild and feckless country boy with a weakness for young women. Misfortune, followed by many spirited adventures as he travels to London to seek his fortune, teach him a sort of wisdom to go with his essential goodheartedness. This comic, epic poem in prose will make the modern reader laugh as much as it did his forbears.
